[Email receipts](https://stripe.com/docs/receipts)

> Stripe can automatically send email receipts after a successful payment, or when you refund one. This is done by providing an email address when making the API request, using the email address of a Customer object, or updating a PaymentIntent with a customerâ€™s email address after checkout
